# *simpleRisc*

## - [ ] **A simple assembly** :yellow_circle:
* Simple risc is an assembly with only 21 instructions that is used in the "Arquitetura de Computadores"'s subject.
* Until now, the only "project" for the subject was to sum two numbers of 256 bits with simple risc and with c.
* The fun part was to do the sum with c, because with the simpleRisc...
* It's so simple that it's nearly impossible to do "complex" things
